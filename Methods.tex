\subsection{Data}

Data for this paper were derived from two sources. The first source was data on Indian migrant community health from a survey that was conducted at the North Island of New Zealand (citation needed). The second source of data was from a survey conducted in India by Dr Srimati Das (SD, an author of this paper). The results from the two surveys will be combined to examine and test the hypothesis that in the process of migration both from one country to another and from one setting to another, changes occur that are related to stresses and possibly life situations and broken promises that eventually result in the health issues that are observed in the affected individuals.

The third approach for this paper will include a close reading of the novel, "Sea of Poppies" and "River of Smoke" and data will be extracted from these two novels to a text analysis software and patterns will be searched based on the previously agreed themes: deception, stressors, and xxxx (we need to specify the themes at this stage).

A concept map will then be constructed to develop the hypothesis a comparable pattern of migration occurs across cultural divides and can contribute to life stresses and eventually lead to the maladjustment that have been observed in the Indian diaspora community that have settled overseas who demonstrate a reversal or deviation from the trend of healthy migrant effect.
