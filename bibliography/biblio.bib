This guy just shrugs his shoulder and passes the bad news and moves on. Then there is this tension with the charioteer who is low caste. we now get to see that circumstances are driving this family to be accosted to the ship(246) The lure of imagined lands(63) The Opium Factory. Remember the opium trade was in the hands of the British; the Indians would have none of it. They were just workers and petty people. The trade and the superintendence was in the hands of the Briitish officers.(61) The trapping of Raskali RajbaRi, part 3, the role of lesser donors and how the Burnhams trapped the Rajahs.(96) (135) How deeti and Kalua became girmitiyas (girmits == ?agreements)(67) Whose health? Whose business? Whose profits? the same old story continues... There are computer coolies, there are call centre workers toiling their days out, and these take a toll on their health. Then there is the lure of money and the dream of making it. But at whose expenses?(55) Slavery and the otehr side's view(130) (30) Neel Rattan Halder was a young man(265) The source of plight! Find a metaphor(110) Nab kissin was a middleman(112) But Naba Kissan would join the ship because of his religious obsession or his obsession with Taramony.

Also, Jodu and Paulette knew each other and that may have played a role too in Jodu's landing up in the ship(65) Colonialism, how the Englishmen treated the men in the land where they came to do business; the submission of the native before the market(120) Deeti was rescued from funeral pyre by Kalua(96) Human beings treated as inhuman animals enslaved in ships - an accidental discovery(56) Not slaves but coolies(71) The dream of the other lands ...(67) (55) Need for Coolies in he ship(65) Men, who were working in the opium processing,manual labourers to feed their masters greed. How different it is this view from the exploitation of the call centres of today where men and women toil, often losing their own names (the names have to sound like Christian names so that they are familiar to foreign ears; their work schedules and hours need to match the comfortable hours or demands of their western masters in call centres; note the similarity between these working conditions and the conditions of the modern day call centres? forget the glitz; it's all the same. But hte fundamental question is, why?(80) the moment of truth; and likewise, we have in our times, our own opium ...(56) transporting coolies(61) The trapping of Rasakali RajbaRi, and how Benjamin Burnham tightened the noose aorund the neck of the Raja Neel Rattan 2(66) ... and the white masters who made these systems move.

Moving on to the metaphor for modern days, we have these people all over India in the modern times, acting at the behest of their masters without thinking twice wha tthey are doing!(60) Beginning of the snare 1(159) Circumstance of Neel Rattan's exile to Mauritius(106) plight of Deeti on many fronts, suicidal ideation to become a Sati, and thoughts of the girl child that she could grow up with her cousins in the village rather than languish.
